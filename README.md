### Greetings, traveller!

*I am a SeÃ±or Software Engineer who
fell in love with Go. After many
years with Python as main language
and daily driver I donâ€™t want to
go back anytime soon.

Currently I am working at
ðŸ“» radio.de GmbH in Hamburg, Germany
- building backend services with Go
and running them on AWS.
