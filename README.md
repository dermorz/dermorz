### Greetings, traveller!

*I am a SeÃ±or Software Engineer who fell in love with Go. After many years with Python as main language and daily driver I donâ€™t want to miss static typing and effortless concurrency anymore.*

Currently I am working at ðŸ“» radio.de GmbH in Hamburg, Germany - building backend services with Go and running them on AWS.
