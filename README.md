### Greetings, traveller!

*I am a SeÃ±or Software Engineer who fell in love with Go. After many years
with Python as main language I donâ€™t want to go back anytime soon.*

Currently I am working at ðŸ“» radio.de GmbH in Hamburg, Germany where I am
building backend services with Go and running them on AWS.
